      <p><strong>Our fees </strong></p>

      <p>The actual fee charged to you will depend on the nature and scope of the advice or service we provide. We will discuss and agree on the actual fees with you before we proceed and explain how they are payable. In most cases for lending, we will not charge fees for our services as most financiers that we work with will pay a commission.</p>

      <p>The following section outlines the types of fees that may apply:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The fees charged for our advice and services may be based on a combination of:
          <ul>
            <li>A set dollar amount; OR</li>
            <li>a percentage-based fee.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Our agreed advice and service fees may include charges for:
          <ul>
            <li>Initial advice ongoing; OR</li>
            <li>annual advice and services.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In some cases, we may charge a fee for our services. This typically applies in the below scenarios:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Commission is not payable from the financier, normally on the below products:
          <ul>
            <li>Business lending</li>
            <li>Commercial property lending / property finance</li>
            <li>Some non-bank lending</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When your lending is repaid within a timeframe which would trigger recovery of the commission received by the Adviser.
          <ul>
            <li>Financiers will claw back upfront commissions to the Adviser when repaid within 28 months (or so) from the drawdown of the funds.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When funding is arranged and there is no intention of proceeding with the drawdown of funds.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will discuss and agree on the applicable fees as soon as it becomes apparent.</p>

      <p><strong>Commissions</strong></p>

      <p>For services in relation to investments and loan products, commissions may be paid by the product provider as follows:</p>

      <p><strong>Initial commission</strong> – A percentage of the value of your investment contributions of loan balance.</p>

      <p><strong>Ongoing Commission</strong> – A percentage of the value of your investment balance or outstanding loan amounts, usually calculated at the end of each month in which you hold the investment or loan.</p>



      <p><strong>Conflicts of interest</strong></p>

      <p>We are here for you and will do the best that we can for you. Although we will receive payment in most cases from the financiers, we will put your interests first when working on your financial needs.</p>

      <p>How we manage any conflicts of interest:</p>

      <p>To ensure our advisers prioritise our clients’ interests:</p>

        <li>All our advisers undergo annual training about how to manage conflicts of interest.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Our duties and obligations to you</strong></p>
